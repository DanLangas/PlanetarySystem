Planetary System
===============

##### A Planetary System Simulation with OpenGL and C++.

It started as a University project, to create a Planetary System with OpenGL.
I now use it as a learning tool, for c++ and OpenGL.
If you want to use any part of this project, feel free.
If you have questions, feel free to ask, and if I can I will answer.

I use a custom deferred lighting system (just point lights) as well as [O'Neil Accurate Atmospheric Scattering Shading](http://http.developer.nvidia.com/GPUGems2/gpugems2_chapter16.html). I also render transparent objects in another pass, witch is very simple.

For the GUI I made a simple GUI system using NanoVG graphics, with basic functionality for text input, sliders and buttons.
